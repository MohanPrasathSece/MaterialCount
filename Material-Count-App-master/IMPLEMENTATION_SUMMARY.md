# Implementation Summary: New In/Out Quantity System

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### What Was Built
A simplified stock management system with direct In/Out quantity adjustments:
- **In Quantity**: Adds to stock (e.g., new purchases, deliveries)
- **Out Quantity**: Reduces from stock (e.g., dispatches, usage)

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **StockAdjustmentModal.tsx**
**Location**: `src/components/materials/StockAdjustmentModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- Modal dialog with tabbed interface (In/Out)
- Real-time stock preview
- Form validation with error display
- Toast notifications
- Auto-close on success

**UI Components Used**:
- Dialog, Tabs, Input, Textarea, Button
- Icons: Plus, Minus, PackagePlus, PackageMinus

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **actions.ts**
**Location**: `src/app/actions.ts`

**Added**:
- `stockAdjustmentSchema` - Zod validation schema
- `stockAdjustmentAction()` - Server action for In/Out operations

**Functionality**:
```typescript
// In: Adds to stock
newStock = currentStock + quantity

// Out: Reduces from stock (with validation)
if (quantity > currentStock) return error
newStock = currentStock - quantity
```

**Database Operations**:
- Updates material quantity
- Records transaction in `stock_history` collection
- Revalidates relevant paths

### 2. **MaterialInventory.tsx**
**Location**: `src/components/materials/MaterialInventory.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `StockAdjustmentModal`
- Added "In/Out" column to desktop table
- Added In/Out button to mobile card view
- Integrated modal component for each material

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Collection: `stock_history`
```javascript
{
  materialId: string,
  materialName: string,
  type: 'in' | 'out',
  quantity: number,
  previousStock: number,
  newStock: number,
  reason: string,
  date: Date
}
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User clicks "In/Out" button** on any material
2. **Modal opens** with two tabs:
   - **In Tab**: For adding stock
   - **Out Tab**: For removing stock
3. **User enters**:
   - Quantity (required)
   - Reason (optional)
4. **Preview shows** calculated new stock
5. **User submits** form
6. **Server validates**:
   - Material exists
   - Sufficient stock (for Out)
   - Valid quantity (≥1)
7. **Database updates**:
   - Material quantity updated
   - Transaction recorded in history
8. **UI updates**:
   - Success toast shown
   - Modal closes
   - Stock table refreshes
   - History updates

### Example Transaction

**Before**:
```
Material: Solar Panel 100W
Stock: 50
```

**User Action**:
```
Type: In
Quantity: 20
Reason: "New supplier delivery"
```

**After**:
```
Material: Solar Panel 100W
Stock: 70

History Entry:
- Type: in
- Quantity: 20
- Previous: 50
- New: 70
- Reason: "New supplier delivery"
- Date: 2025-10-30 10:40 PM
```

## 🔒 Validation & Safety

### Input Validation
- ✅ Quantity must be ≥ 1
- ✅ Type must be 'in' or 'out'
- ✅ Material must exist

### Business Logic
- ✅ **Out**: Cannot remove more than available stock
- ✅ Real-time stock calculations
- ✅ Clear error messages

### Error Handling
- Material not found
- Insufficient stock
- Invalid data
- Server errors

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Green theme** for In (additions)
- **Orange/Red theme** for Out (removals)
- **Real-time preview** of new stock
- **Warning indicators** for insufficient stock

### Responsive Design
- ✅ Desktop: Table column with button
- ✅ Mobile: Card layout with centered button
- ✅ Modal: Adapts to screen size

### User Feedback
- ✅ Toast notifications (success/error)
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Validation messages
- ✅ Preview calculations

A: You're trying to remove more than available. Check current stock.

**Q: Where is the history stored?**
A: In the `stock_history` MongoDB collection. View it in the Stock History section.

**Q: Can I edit past transactions?**
A: No, transactions are immutable for audit purposes. Make a new adjustment if needed.
